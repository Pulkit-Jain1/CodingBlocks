//control structures $ if-else

//control structures - to give flow to programmes of 3 types of basic control structures
/*
1   sequence structure-
1st we took entry 
than performed action 1 than action 2 than action 3 ......
than took exit from programme
2    selection structure-
first we took entry
than we apply a condition 
than weather true of false 
if true we performd a1 
if false than perform a2
than exit
3     loop structure-
first we took entry
than comes loop and we check a condition if T than again loop if it becomes false we exit our loop
than exit



to model these in programmes there are few ways like
1    if-else statement
2    if else ladder - multiple if else statements
3    switch case */
