/*type of operators in C++
1 assignment operator---> = for eg x=5 assign x value of 5
2 bitwise operator -----> that operator which operate on bits
    they are of 4 types
    a & bitwise and (used as both binary and unary operator)
    b | bitise or
    c ^ bitwise XOR
    d ~ bitwise not
3 shift operator << left shift , >> right shift
4 unary operators --> they operate on single operant for example & (address of operaor), *(dereferencing operator)(it is also arithmatic operator if use on 2 operants) ,new,delete etc.
5 arithmatic operator ----> +,-,/,*
6 ternary operator ---> example ?:---> condition?satement(if condition is true):statement(if false)
    example 7%2(non zero and any non zero is t)?cout"odd"(this will get executed):cout<<"even" 
    x= time>6 am ? "morning":"evening"
    it is like  shortcut for if else condition
7 comma operator ---> denoted using ,
    uses ---> we know
8 relational operators--->eg 5>7 will give you T or false other eg ---> <=,<,>,>=,==,!=
9 logical operators ---> and/&& , or/|| used to combine different expressions 
    shortcircuit concept --> example 8<5 and 8%2 != 0 ---> if 1st condition if false than 2nd condition will not be checked in and
                        ---> 8>5 or 8%2=0 ---> if 1st condition is true than we need not check 2nd condition
10 post/pre increment and decrement operators ---> x=5;y=x++;cout<<x<<y;ans will be 6 and 5 assignment will occur first than increment
                                            -----> y=++x first increment will happen and then assignement will happen
11 compound assignment ----> x=x+5 is equivalent to x += 5 this will increment value of x by 5   , x*=5 ---> x=x*5 , x%=7-->x = x % 7
         other examples--> +=,-=,*=,/=,%=,<<=,>>=*/
